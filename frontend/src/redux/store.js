/*
The Redux Store is like a big brain or central data warehouse that holds all the appâ€™s state (data) in one place.

Imagine you're building an app like Amazon:
User logs in âœ…
Cart has 3 items ðŸ›’
Dark mode is on ðŸŒ™

All this info (user, cart, UI settings) is stored in the Redux store, not spread out across different components. This way, any component can access it if needed.
